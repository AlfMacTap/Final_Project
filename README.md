# Final_Project
Project overview 
Tidal flooding frequency and intensity is increasing along with sea level rise. Despite the attention to problems these events cause in infrastructure and economics, little is known about water quality impacts caused by tidal flooding events. Materials accumulating on areas prompt to be impacted by inundation could be carried on the retreating water.
Here, I use weather data (i.e. precipitation) to build a model that predicts changes in dissolved nitrogen concentrations during tidal flooding events (mean lower low water > 3ft) occurring between 2000 and 2017 in the Lafayette River, Norfolk, VA.

Instructions for using the code 
Specific instructions to run this code can be found within the attached notebooks. 
A brief summary of the code is included at the top of each notebook.
Steps for the code were written as ‘heading’, while comments and discussion of results were written as ‘markdown’.
This code was done using python3.6.7.
Necessary packages to use this code are:
•	pandas;
•	numpy;
•	matplotlib.pyplot;
•	PIL;
•	sklearn.model_selection;
•	sklearn.preprocessing;
•	scipy.
Data access 
Detailed information on the data used in this project and how to access it is given within the “Data processing” python notebook.
